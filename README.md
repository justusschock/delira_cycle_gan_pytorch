# Cycle GAN

This package contains a [`delira`](https://github.com/justusschock/delira) 
compatible cycle GAN skeleton, which should work for arbitrary dimensions and
 datatypes.
 
 An example for 2D images can be found in the [notebooks](notebooks) 
 folder.
 
 The paper, this package is based on, can be found at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593).
